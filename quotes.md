1. `Master software engineers have the ability to organize programs so that they can be reasonably sure that the resulting processes will perform the tasks intended.“They can visualize the behavior of their systems in advance. They know how to structure programs so that unanticipated problems do not lead to catastrophic consequences, and when problems do arise, they can debug their programs. Well-designed computational systems, like well-designed automobiles or nuclear reactors, are designed in a modular manner, so that the parts can be constructed, replaced, and debugged separately.`

2. `The importance of the decomposition startegy is not simply hat one is divding the program into parts. Rather, it is crucial that each procedure accomplishes an identifiable task that can be used as a module in defining other procedures, (Pg 26)`
